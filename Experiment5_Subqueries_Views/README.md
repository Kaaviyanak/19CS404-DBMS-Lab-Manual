# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
## Name:KAAVIYAN.K
## Reg.no:212224240066
## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length

Departments Table


```sql
SELECT department_id,department_name
from Departments
WHERE LENGTH (department_name)>
(
SELECT AVG(LENGTH(department_name))
FROM Departments
)
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $1500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
